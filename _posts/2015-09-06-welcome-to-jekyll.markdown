So I've finally started using GitHub more and decided that it is time for me to give me a reason to code more frequent. I've picked up a few programming languages already, but I've grown to like rust more than any other language I have yet encountered. And this without really being able to code a fully working rust program from scratch.
So I thought I should give myself some reason to learn rust, to do some small Projects, to maybe even help others that are in the same spot as me. We'll see what time has in store for me and this Blog.
For now you will have to be satisfied by this introduction post.

The only rust Project that I can show you for now is my [text-splitter]:https://github.com/fabiovitalba/file_splitter, which I used to divide the plaintext export of a NAV Database into manageable and (most of all) searchable chunks. I needed this since the software I usually use only works for 2013 and onwards.
